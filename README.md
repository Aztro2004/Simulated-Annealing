## Affilation
Final project for the 2025-2 High-performance computing class, designed and developed at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MÃ©xico(UNAM), at the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores (ENES Morelia). A project carried out by a student of the Bachelor's Degree in Technologies for Information in the Sciences.
## Introduction
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique used to find the global minimum of an objective function by escaping local minima.

## Justification

This proyect aims to paralelize neighbor making and evaluation. By parallelizing this we can fasten the process at which Simulated Annealing, converges to the final temperature, thus ending the cycle and finding the best solution up until now. 
## Hypothesis

Simulated Annealing can be parallelized thus decreasing time of at which the algorihm performs in high density search spaces.
## General Objetive 

The goal is to adapt Simulated Annealing.
## Particular Objectives
* Parallelize neighbor making.
* Parallelize neighbor evaluation.
* Reduce algorithm time duration.
